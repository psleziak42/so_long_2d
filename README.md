# so_long_2d

##### The objectve of this project was to create 2D game top-down view. The player must collect all "collectibles" and get to exit in given number of moves otherwise he loses. It also implements elements that if touched make player to loose the game. Collectibles and fire are animated. <br/>

##### Size of the window depends on the map. Each map parametre represents 32x32 dimension, hence all images have this size. "1" is wall (rock), "0" is moving space (grass), "P" is Player (it is this shrub), "E" is exit (piece of wood), "W" is so called "enemy patrol" that cases loose (fire) <br/>

##### When player wins the game a green string "WON" is displayed in the middle of the screen and the character changes into Charmander.<br/>
##### When player looses the game a red string "LOSE" is displayed in the middle of the screen and the character changes into ghost.<br/>

##### You can find few images from the game inside IMG folder :)
